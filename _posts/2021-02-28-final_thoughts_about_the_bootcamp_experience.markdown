Wow, what a journey it has been. Learning everything from writing a "Hello World" program in ruby to Single Page Applications and State Management with React and Redux. I will admit a few times I really struggled. Especially with time management. Working full time and dedicating so much time to learning I knew would be worth it, but it didn't make it easier. 

With the help from my wonderful peers and excellent staff here at flatiron I was able to learn and achieve more with code than I thought I ever could. It was a great experience and I'm so glad I had the opprotunity to do it. I now have the tools and the confidents to take on any and all projects that come my way in the future from future employers. Can't wait to get started
