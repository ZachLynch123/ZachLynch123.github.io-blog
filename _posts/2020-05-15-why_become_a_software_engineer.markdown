Computers have always been something I've gravitated to ever since I was a kid. I remember staying up late with my dad watching this old TV show with my dad called *Screen Savers*. It's basically a 90s TV program that talked about hardware and/or software technology going on durring that time. We would spend afternoons taking apart, cleaning, and rebuilding computers where I would probably ask too many questions about how things worked. I had the idea that I would go into IT and be a System Administrator or something along those lines, but then I found a beginner class for programming. 

I instantly fell in love and decided that this is what I wanted to do for a living.  I find being able to make a computer do any creative task I can think of not only a unique skill that is coveted around the world but also something that's... well, cool! If I could choose which role I'd like to fill in the world of Software Engineering, it'd probably be Back-End development, since I'm not the best at making things look nice. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me and I look forward to learning anything and everything I can to be the best engineer I can be.
