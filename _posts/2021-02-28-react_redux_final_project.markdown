I did my final project based on a common issue I find myself running into day after day. Whenever my friends and I get together to play games online, we never seem to have a solid knowledge of what games we all have in common. Sometime's I'd suggest playing something like Halo, Stardew Valley, or Dark Souls, only to be disappointed to find one out of 5 friends doesn't have the suggested game. So, I created an app that takes in a steam id, and outputs all the friends. The user can then click on each friend to add them to a list, then when hitting search the application will send back all the games the group has in common with the user.

It sounded like a pretty straight forward project, but man was I wrong. It took me the whole 2 weeks to finish it and it was quite the learning experience. The thing I struggled with the most would probably be async redux. Just couldn't seem to get it to work. All in all it was a wonderfully frustrating experience that I know I learned a ton from. If you have steam feel free to clone my repo [here.](https://github.com/ZachLynch123/steam-games-2)
