Firebase is a mobile development platform that helps one build, maintain, improve, and grow applications. 
Sure that explains what it is, but what IS Firebase?

Firebase is a Back-end As A Service (BAAS) that has multiple tools to assist developers in making lightning quick, real-time entries to their database, host their products, handle authentication, and many other cloud-based services. I've personally used it to create a backend for a google drive clone. 

Firebase is easy to use, fun to learn, and a great skill to learn and add to the resume.
