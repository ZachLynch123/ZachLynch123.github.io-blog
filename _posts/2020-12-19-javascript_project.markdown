The project I made allows users to adopt dogs from a shelter. It was a great learning experience and I enjoyed making it. 

The backend was a bit daunting at first. I've never created an API before from scratch, but rails made it surprisingly easy. For this project specifially, the --api flag when creating the project took a lot of the heavy lifting out of making the api. The only thing I personally had trouble with was the database relationships. 

The frontend was something I was also slightly apprehensive about. Making a single page web applicaiton in vanilla JavaScript was something I've never done before. But I noticed as long as I don't overthink the project and make sure to keep my code as clean as possible, it'll get done right. 

Overall I think this project was a great learning experience and I can't wait to see what the next project has in store for us.
