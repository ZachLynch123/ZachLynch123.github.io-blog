<p>I'm a mostly self-taught, ambitious aspiring software engineer with a thirst for knowledge. I started my journey back in high school, taking a beginner coding class and instantly fell in love with it. Websites, scripts, embedded systems, doesn't matter. I find being able to make a computer do any creative task I can think of not only a unique skill that is coveted around the world but also something that's... well, cool! I've mainly created small websites using react. I've also dabbled in creating scripting and native Android applications. I've created this blog to record my journey, posting any interesting lessons, coding tasks, and any experiments I come up with. I hope that those who read my blog can utilize my posts as a stepping stone in their journey to be the best engineer they can be. Good luck out there, and happy coding! :)</p>
